# TODOs

Goal: PHP 7.0 as min requirement (supports most systems)
    oder lieber 8.0?
    mal schauen, was der compat check ergibt

- WordPress Version + PHP Version https://wordpress.org/about/stats/
- WP Version / PHP Compatability https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/


Respect Special Content Folders:

# Open

# Version 1.2
- save paths relativ to root
    WP_LANG_DIR
- store root in database

# Version 1.3

# Version 1.x
- idea: data must be saved to wp-content/disk-usage-insights directory!
    - that dir should also contain an empty index.php file
    - add a hook to delete snapshots on uninstall (not needed right now)
- worker should take a look at max_execution_time
- show error-jobs on snapshot result page
- exclude wp-core files from output
- create a workflow for steps before publishing next plugin version
    - ensure that IDE shows no PHP errors
    - Plugin Check
    - check sonarcloud
- make sure that CSS is nice
- make sure that safety issues are met
- clean up the building of URLs (admin_url etc.)
- clean up referencing of __DIR__ . '/../../../output'
- switch templating with mustache or similar
- make better error message for corrupt databases
- "Largest Plugin Folder" + "Largest Theme Folders"
